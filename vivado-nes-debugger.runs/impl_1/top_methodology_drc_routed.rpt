TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.470 ns between debuggerTop/video_output_sync/r_data_0_reg/C (clocked by o_clk_25mhz_clk_wiz_0_1) and debuggerTop/video_output_sync/r_data_1_reg/D (clocked by o_clk_5mhz_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between debuggerTop/nes/cpu2A03/cpu6502/dor/r_oam[127][0]_i_1/I1 and debuggerTop/nes/cpu2A03/cpu6502/dor/r_oam[127][0]_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#1 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint. First endpoint covered by the constraint: debuggerTop/video_fifo/fifo_ip/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gcx.clkx/rd_pntr_cdc_inst/dest_graysync_ff_reg[0][0]/D

TIMING-38#2 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint. First endpoint covered by the constraint: debuggerTop/video_fifo/fifo_ip/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gcx.clkx/wr_pntr_cdc_inst/dest_graysync_ff_reg[0][0]/D
